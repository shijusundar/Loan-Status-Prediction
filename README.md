# Loan-Status-Prediction
Loan status prediction is the process of using machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a loan being repaid or defaulted based on historical data
Project Overview
This project aims to predict loan status (repaid or defaulted) based on various features such as credit score, loan amount, employment history, etc.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
Numpy
Sklearn
Matplotlib
File Description
loan_data.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the model
loan_status_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for training and testing the model
requirements.txt: List of packages required to run the project
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine
Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch the Jupyter notebook by running jupyter notebook loan_status_prediction.ipynb
Run the cells in the notebook to train the model and make predictions on test data
Results
The model was trained on the loan data and achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy here]. The performance of the model can be improved by incorporating more features or using more sophisticated models.

Conclusion
This project provides a basic implementation of a loan status prediction model. It can serve as a starting point for further exploration and improvement.
