# Loan-Status-Prediction
Loan status prediction is the process of using machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a loan being repaid or defaulted based on historical data
Project Overview

This project aims to predict loan status (repaid or defaulted) based on various features such as credit score, loan amount, employment history, etc.

Requirements

Python 3.x
Pandas
Numpy
Sklearn
Matplotlib

File Description

loan_data.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the model
loan_status_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for training and testing the model

Results

The model was trained on the loan data and achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy here]. The performance of the model can be improved by incorporating more features or using more sophisticated models.

Conclusion

This project provides a basic implementation of a loan status prediction model. It can serve as a starting point for further exploration and improvement.
